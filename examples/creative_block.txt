# ProcessLang Example: Dissolving Creative Blocks

# Use case: When feeling stuck in creative work
# ProcessLang approach: Dissolve rigidity, increase flow, allow emergence

FLOW engagement=0.7 resistance=0.4
# Moderate engagement with acknowledged resistance
# Creative blocks ARE resistance - we work with it, not against it

DISSOLVE rigidity=0.9 target="need for perfect output"
# High rigidity dissolution for perfectionism
# "Perfect output" crystallizes process into form
# Let it go to allow creative flow

OBSERVE distance=0.1 target="resistance_itself"
# Close observation of the resistance mechanism
# Low distance = intense observation
# Understand what the block is made of

CONNECT depth=0.6 between=["play", "exploration", "mistakes"]
# Connect concepts that support creative flow
# Play, exploration, and accepting mistakes
# Moderate depth - gentle connections, not forced

MANIFEST format="minimal" loss=0.7
# Minimal output format
# HIGH information loss is intentional
# Creative blocks dissolve when pressure to produce is released

QUERY: What wants to emerge when I stop forcing?
# The query itself is process-oriented
# Not "how to break the block" but "what emerges naturally"
