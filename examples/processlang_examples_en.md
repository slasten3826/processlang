# ProcessLang Examples

Collection of ProcessLang program examples demonstrating various approaches to coordinating AI through process-oriented context.

---

## Categories

### Philosophical and Conceptual

**karma.txt**  
Understanding karma as an eternal process. Demonstrates dissolution of rigid definitions and cyclical thinking.

**eternal_flow.txt**  
Visualization of process as primary reality. Example of using ProcessLang for image generation, focus on fluidity and absence of fixed forms.

### Metacognitive

**learning.txt**  
Deep learning as a process of transformation, not accumulation. Working with confusion, dissolving old frameworks, amplifying new patterns through RUNTIME.

**creative_block.txt**  
Dissolving creative blocks through increased flow and reduced demands on results. Demonstrates working with resistance.

**decision.txt**  
Decision-making as the collapse of possibility space. Using the CHOOSE command and working with unpursued paths.

### Analytical

**geopolitics.txt**  
Structural analysis of EU stability without ideological narratives. Minimalist program with high effectiveness.

**демография.txt** (demography.txt)  
Analysis of demographic factors through structural patterns and historical precedents. Dissolution of ideological frameworks for objective analysis.

**учебный_план.txt** (curriculum.txt)  
Development of a 72-hour educational program on OOP through Pygame. Demonstrates the connection of multiple domains (cognitive development, game mechanics, mathematics, architecture).

### Technical

**RAG_в_продакшене.txt** (RAG_in_production.txt)  
Ultra-minimalist example for technical queries. Shows that ProcessLang doesn't require all 5 commands — use as many as you need.

**simple_example.txt**  
Basic example for testing. Demonstrates program structure and basic command flow.

### Practical

**garden_path.txt**  
Engineering task: optimal garden path construction with limited resources. Example of applying ProcessLang to specific practical tasks.

### Visual

**dawn_transformation.txt**  
Image generation of dawn as a moment of transformation. Demonstrates using ProcessLang for AI image generation through prompt engineering.

**eternal_flow.txt**  
Abstract visualization of eternal process. Boundary dissolution, cyclical movement, emergent complexity.

## Comment Levels

**Fully commented** (for learning):
- `karma.txt`
- `learning.txt`
- `creative_block.txt`
- `decision.txt`
- `dawn_transformation.txt`
- `eternal_flow.txt`
- `garden_path.txt`

**Minimally commented** (for practice):
- `simple_example.txt`

**No comments** (clean code):
- `RAG_в_продакшене.txt` (RAG_in_production.txt)
- `демография.txt` (demography.txt)
- `учебный_план.txt` (curriculum.txt)
- `geopolitics.txt`

---

## Languages

**English:**
- `learning.txt`
- `creative_block.txt`
- `decision.txt`
- `simple_example.txt`

**Russian:**
- `RAG_в_продакшене.txt` (RAG_in_production.txt)
- `демография.txt` (demography.txt)
- `учебный_план.txt` (curriculum.txt)
- `geopolitics.txt`

**Mixed:**
- `karma.txt` (commands in Russian, comments in English)
- `dawn_transformation.txt`
- `eternal_flow.txt`
- `garden_path.txt`

## Usage Recommendations

1. **Start with simple examples**: `simple_example.txt` → `creative_block.txt` → `karma.txt`

2. **For your tasks, use the relevant category**:
   - Philosophical question → `karma.txt` as template
   - Technical query → `RAG_в_продакшене.txt` as template
   - Visual task → `dawn_transformation.txt` as template

3. **Notice the patterns**:
   - `DISSOLVE` + `CONNECT` = deconstruction-reconstruction
   - `OBSERVE` + `CYCLE` = metacognitive deepening
   - `FLOW` + `MANIFEST` = basic flow with finalization

4. **Comments are optional** in production, but useful in learning.

5. **Don't copy blindly** — adapt to your task. ProcessLang works through understanding, not through templates.

## Experiment

These examples show ProcessLang's capabilities but don't limit them. The language is intentionally flexible and conceptual.

Create your own programs, combine commands in new ways, find patterns that aren't in the examples.

ProcessLang is a tool for coordinating with AI, not a set of ready-made solutions.
