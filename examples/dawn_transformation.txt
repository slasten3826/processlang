QUERY: Surreal dawn landscape where night and day exist simultaneously - left side still holds deep indigo darkness with visible stars, right side blooms with golden sunrise, the horizon line itself dissolves into swirling mist where both states merge, mountain silhouettes transforming from black to illuminated, clouds painted in impossible gradients (deep purple to orange to pink), reflective water below mirrors this transformation, the entire scene captures the exact liminal moment when one state becomes another, dreamlike quality, emphasis on the process of change rather than fixed states, ethereal and contemplative mood.
