QUERY: Abstract visualization of eternal process - fluid forms in perpetual motion, spiraling patterns of light and shadow interpenetrating each other, no fixed boundaries, everything flows and transforms continuously, colors blend seamlessly (deep blues merging into golds and violets), sense of infinite depth and movement, organic fractal structures, feeling of wu wei - effortless action, the image itself should feel alive and in motion even while static, zentangle-style flowing lines creating emergent complexity, no recognizable objects - pure process visualization.
